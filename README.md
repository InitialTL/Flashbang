<h1>Flash Background Script</h1>

<p>
This repository contains a small, self-contained HTML file that alternates
the background color of a web page at a configurable interval.
The project was created for educational and experimental purposes,
focusing on learning basic JavaScript timing functions and DOM manipulation.
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>
The script uses JavaScript’s <code>setInterval</code> function to repeatedly
switch the background color of the page between two values.
All configuration is embedded directly in the HTML file,
allowing it to run offline without requiring a server or external files.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
The following values can be adjusted in the configuration section of the HTML file:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>delay</code> – time in milliseconds between background changes</li>
  <li><code>color1</code> – first background color</li>
  <li><code>color2</code> – second background color</li>
</ul>
